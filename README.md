<b>Project2.nb-1.html (Finding patterns in DNA using poisson process):</b>
The goal of this project was to detect possible sites which could be the origin of replication of Cytomegalovirus by finding patterns in the human DNA using poisson process.

<b>Project_3.nb.html (Population genetic difference between warblers):</b>
Analyzed population genetic differences (using Fst) between golden-winged and blue-winged warblers with the help of Bayesian estimation and binomial-beta models.

<b>Project4.nb.html (Hierarchical model (F-model) for allele frequencies):</b>
I used a hierarchical model to quantify the allele frequency of blue winged and golden winged warblers relative to the common ancestor and compared the Hudson's Fst estimate (fixed effect statistic) to the estimate of Fst from F-model (random effect parameter).
